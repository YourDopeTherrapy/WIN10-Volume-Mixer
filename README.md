This Registry script adds a new option named "ClassicVolumeMixer" to your desktop's right-click menu. Clicking it launches the classic Windows 10-style volume mixer directly.


You cannot directly change the right-click menu of the taskbar speaker icon itself through standard scripts or registry edits. That menu is a protected system component in Windows 11 and its options are hard-coded by Microsoft.

The methods I provided are workarounds to get to the classic mixer quickly, but they don't modify the original speaker menu.



right-click on an empty space on the Desktop.
